Examples of some projects using Python.


#  [Project 1: Found faces and text in zip files of images](https://github.com/scastrodri/Python_projects/tree/main/Faces_and_text_%20in_zip)
* Take a zip file of scanned images. Detect faces and text to find a specific word in every one of the images in the zip file.
* Print a legend that shows up the amount found of the specific word.
* With the faces detected create a contact sheet to show every one of them.

# [Project 2: Graphing data with the Turtle module](https://github.com/scastrodri/Python_projects/tree/main/Graphic_Turtle)
* There are many tools to graph data, but let's 'code' our own graphs from scratch using the turtle module.
* The data used is part of [Kiva](http://kiva.org/) that is an international nonprofit, founded in 2005 and based in San Francisco, with a mission to connect people 
through lending to alleviate poverty.
* The first one will be a bar chart that shows the total amount of loans for country.
* The second one is a scatter plot that prints the loan amount vs the total number of lenders.
* The last one is a histogram (using the bar chart) that is used to display 10 differents 'buckets' that are 'categories' from the loan amount.

# [Project 3: Image Processing](https://github.com/scastrodri/Python_projects/tree/main/Image_Processing)
Much of the filters here exists are built-in functions that use numpy arrays, but in this case will be use the putpixel method, although it's a little bit slow, it's very easy and intuitive to use.

* Some basic filters as grayscale, black and white, sepia tone, neon filter, negative filter.
* A little bit of rotating, scaling and blending.
* Image Kernel for cleaning up noise (Replace every pixel with the median pixel value of the 8 pixels around it).
